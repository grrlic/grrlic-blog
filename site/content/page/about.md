Hello, **World**! I love hacking with data, identifying trends, discovering correlations, and finally presenting some useful information from them. Currently, I put more focus on machine learning and do some side-research on neural networks. Besides machine learning, I do algorithmic questions that help hone my problem-solving skills. Also, I am pretty active on [Github](https://github.com/grrlic) and [CodeForces](https://codeforces.com/profile/grrlic). Please feel free to reach me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/grrlic).
